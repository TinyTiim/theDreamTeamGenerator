# theDreamTeamGenerator

## Description

With this project you can create your own dream team, so ideally with this project you will be able to save data of your team with infomation such as ID,name,email, and position.

## Installation

Used both inquirer.js and node.js for this project.

## Usage

I believe this can be useful in cases where you need just a simple html page to keep all the contact info logged from your team members. Lets say for instance you need to contact someone from ur team, it will have either their email, office number, or github.

I have no current previews yet for this project.
